This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Starting the Project

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your system.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
      npm i
4. Start the project by running:
      npm start
5. Open your browser and navigate to the URL shown in the terminal (e.g http://localhost:3000, it can change if 3000 port is already in use) to use the project.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

### Project Features
